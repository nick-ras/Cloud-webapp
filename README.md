This is a flask webapp, that has a db with 2 tables, a users table and a boxes table. I made a frontend website where users can log in and book boxes for 6-48 hours. A realistic scenario could be for storage boxes around the city for getting packages or renting things.
I use sqlalchemy for securing against sql injection, and FLASK_WTF for CRSF.
I also my unit and integration tests in the pytests folder.
