#The setup method creates all your tables; authors and articles tables. It then defines the session, which is the Session object in SQLAlchemy in which the conversation with the database occurs
#Software test fixtures initialize test functions. They provide a fixed baseline so that tests execute reliably and produce consistent, repeatable, results. Initialization may setup services, state, or other operating environments. These are accessed by test functions through arguments; for each fixture used by a test function there is typically a parameter (named after the fixture) in the test functionâ€™s definition.
